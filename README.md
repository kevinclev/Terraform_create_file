# Terraform_create_file
I needed to test to some things with creating a file in Terraform so I made a Git repo out of it  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

## Overview 
If you wanna see how files are created with Terraform and template files, then you've come to the right place. Is there really a purpose to creating files with just Terraform alone? Not really. But I started playing around with the config for another project and decided that this _could_ be a good learning resource. Idk maybe I'll drop this is a blog someday.

## Additional Info
Terraform Version 0.12.x
